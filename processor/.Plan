[] Break video into frames
[] diff frames in sets of 24
[] make image masks
[] make montage 720x405 13 frames per key (for color and b/w)
	- looks like 2k frames would be ideal (1920x1080)
	- determine keyframe quality (image size = frameWidth/quality)
	- will need to make this variable for 
[] test compression with jpg and with png8


[] load key frames
[] play audio
[] on rAF, play the correct frame for the time (if required draw multiple frames)
[] jump to frame by drawing prev keyframe + intermediates

[] build buffer system
